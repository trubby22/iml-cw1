# WiFi decision tree algorithm

The WiFi decision tree algorithm determines your location based on signal strengths of several WiFi routers. It is assumed that the user stands in one of 5 rooms in a flat with multiple routers placed around.
It was developed during the 3rd year Intro to Machine Learning module at Imperial College London

## Running instructions

To run the cross-validation, run

```
python3 main.py
```

This will output the evaluation results for the pruned and unpruned decision trees from the clean and unclean datasets.
