# WiFi decision tree algorithm

The WiFi decision tree algorithm determines one of the indoor locations based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone. It is assumed that the mobile phone is in one of 4 rooms in a flat with 7 routers placed around.

It was developed during the 3rd year Intro to Machine Learning module at Imperial College London.

## Running instructions

To run the cross-validation, run

```
python3 main.py
```

This will output the evaluation results for the pruned and unpruned decision trees from the clean and unclean datasets.
